# popcornrp-grapeseedclinic

A small rural clinic for the Grapeseed area and its surroundings in the great state of San Andreas! Created for Popcorn Roleplay, we worked with our partners to build on our current clinic which needed some major updating and decided to release it to the great FiveM community!

For map makers and other creators, please note that while working on this map, our partners noted that while possible, the foundations of this MLO aren't the best, so be forewarned of any strange issues you may run into.
